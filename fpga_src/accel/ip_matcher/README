To get latest google CDN IPs:

curl https://www.gstatic.com/ipranges/cloud.json | jq '.prefixes[] | .ipv4Prefix // .ipv6Prefix' -r |sort -r

Python files are simplified from another project, do the following to use them:
- add value 1 to each line of the generated CDN IPs. Also remove IPv6 entries.
- run prefix_parser.py
- [optional] run data_analyzer.py to see ip distribution, for example to see longest prefix is /24.
- run ip_match_generator.py to generate the verilog files
